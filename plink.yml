# this is a list of fabrications. a fabrication take a part(s) or assembl(ies) (any thing that implments "cad.Thing") as an input and produces a Thing as an output.
# examples would a piece of raw sheet plastic (from a source) and laser cut using a DXF file to produce a solid. (e.g. most of the pieces in the OpenROV cad)
fabrications:
  - inputs:
      - class: "stock" # redundant if using canonical name
        name: "stock, sheet, acrylic, 3mm" # canonical name
      - class: "vectors"
        name: "Shell" # this will come from the Shell.dxf in this example
  - outputs:
      - class: "part"
        type: "Shell"
