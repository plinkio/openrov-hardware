#Ok, maybe this is simpler. How about, just a list of files to parse?
# will someday probably want options under some of these files... 

# hmmm here is a problem. OpenROV uses multiple git
# repos. e.g. hardware and electronics. This is going to be a very
# common use case. soo..... need to unify this somehow. only way I can
# see is w/ plink level DB action.  so this whole plan isn't really
# going to work.  need to create a project and then add repos and the
# files and stuff.  a way around this is you have to make a "master"
# repo where you link docs to all of the other repos.

# ah, finally found the BOM I thought they had. It's link to a google doc from README.md

# :facepalm:
# bleh. anyway to read in a google doc?
# yes? https://developers.google.com/google-apps/spreadsheets/?hl=en
# sounds like it is part of gdata client lib?
# https://developers.google.com/gdata/docs/client-libraries?hl=en
# oh man, f this: just export it as a .csv. bleh.
# here is some python that works w/ sheets:
