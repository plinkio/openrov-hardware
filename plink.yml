assemblies:

    subassemblies:
      # same naming rules in parts -- you could instatiate two "Shell" subassemblies and give them names.
      - name: "Shell"
        assembly: "Shell" # this is redundant when name == assembly
      - name: "Main Structure"
      

  - assembly: "Shell" # if only assembly is provided, then this is a "class"
    parts:
      # these are referencing components
      # (but what if the component and the parts have different names?
      # then you would do
      # - component: "Shell"
      #   name: "S1"
      # if you wanted to make a Shell part named S1.
      # otherwise the name is the same as the component name
      - name: "Shell"
        component: "Shell" # also redundant
      - name: "Fin" # the component implied here is "Fin"
